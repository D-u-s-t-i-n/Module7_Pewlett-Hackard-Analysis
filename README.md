## Project Summary
Of the 300024 employees, 71193 employees are likely to retire based on the 1952-1955 birth date criteria. Only 1549 are ready for mentoring based on the 1965 birth date criteria. Based on these numbers, mentoring process must begin immediately to prevent a shortage of eligible replacements for the retirees.  
If more time for analysis was given, I would look into the number of retirees and eligible mentors per department, to see which department requires most attention in terms of mentoring expertise.
